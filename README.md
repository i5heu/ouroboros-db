# OuroborosDB

## Name and Logo

The name "OuroborosDB" is derived from the ancient symbol "Ouroboros," a representation of cyclical events, continuity, and endless return. Historically, it's been a potent symbol across various cultures, signifying the eternal cycle of life, death, and rebirth. In the context of this database, the Ouroboros symbolizes the perpetual preservation and renewal of data. While the traditional Ouroboros depicts a serpent consuming its tail, our version deviates, hinting at both reverence for historical cycles and the importance of continuous adaptation in the face of change.
